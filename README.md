# Python Community Map
A map full of lovely Python communities 🐍❤️  currently deployed at https://community.python.org.br/.

*This is not a map for specific events or conferences, but rather for local communities.*

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonatasbaldin/python-community-map.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonatasbaldin/python-community-map)

## How to add a new community to the map?
### 1. Fork this repo
First of all, fork this repo :) You can find instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) or [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

### 2. Add your community
Add your community information to the `communities.yaml` file, with the following structure:
```yaml

  url: https://www.meetup.com/grupy-rp/
```

If you are adding a new country, add a comment header before the community:

### 3. Make a pull request
At the end, create a pull request for this repository! You can find instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## A note on scrapping
> Personally, I want to avoid web scrapping to mass collect communities from other websites or repositories, because I'd like to see people adding the communities they _belong_ to. I think it creates a better sense of "putting yourself on the map" and also incentivise people to contribute to open source :)

## Testing
To run the tests locally, you'll need NodeJS, probably version 8 or higher. I'm using v10.

Install everything:
```
$ npm install
```

Run the tests:
```
$ npm test
```
